Convolutional Networks

* Implement the ConvNet, train it and visualizing its weights(Question 1).
* Experiment with batch normalization and early stopping (Question 2).
* Data augmentation and dropout to improve generalization (Question 3).
* Implement transfer learning from a ImageNet pretrained model. (Question 4).
